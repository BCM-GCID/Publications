This consists of all the scripts, used to assemble the genome and compare to older *Cryptosporidium parvum* assemblies. All scripts and outputs have also been submitted to GigaScience as part of the manuscript submission.

**Long-read Sequencing :**
  - The DNA from *Cryptosporidium parvum* oocyst was run on the PromethION :
    - Flow Cell : FLO-PRO002
    - Library was prepared using the kit : SQK-LSK110
    - Basecalling was done using the on-board installed Guppy software version : 4.0.11+f1071ce

**Short-read Sequencing :**
  - The DNA from the same extraction used for long-read sequencing was used to generate short-read data. The data was used for polishing of the assembly.
    - Library preparation : Kapa Hyper protocol was used without PCR amplification
    - Library name to track in the HGSC LIMS : ILWGS_GCIDWP_GCIDP3_crypto_202001116_273718_1
    - Instrument : NovaSeq 6000
    - Instrument id : A00733
    - Flow cell id : H5TTKDSX2
    - Lane barcode : H5TTKDSX2-4-IDUDI0001



The assembled genome has been deposited at NCBI under
 - BioProject : PRJNA744539 ,  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/744539
 - BioSample : SAMN20223754 , https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN20223754/
 - The raw data from both the short-read and long-read sequencing are also being uploaded under the same BioProject.
